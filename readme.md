# Omnifood

## My very first website

Omnifood is a fake food subscription company. This website was created as my final project for a HTML and CSS course, where I learnt:

- HTML and CSS Fundamentals
- Layouts: Floats, Flexbox and CSS Grid
- Web Design rules and good practices
- Components and Layout Patterns
- Responsiveness
- Basic effects and animations
